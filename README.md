## About
Making use of the Unity Game Engine and under the supervision of Dr. Hugh Smith at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, I was able to further my knowledge of game development techniques through the creation of this mobile 2D Android game. Broadening my knowledge, I focused on including important aspects of the software and game development process such as version control, object-oriented programming, storyboarding, design flow, and user testing. The Unity Engine’s cross platform build compatibility combined with its beginner friendly design made it the perfect choice to build the game on. 

## Documentation Files
Listed below are documents we have gathered that provide further insight into the development of this API.

To keep track of different classes, I've created a [UML diagram](documentation/UML_DIAGRAM.pdf)

In order to keep in touch with user flow, an example storyboard can be found [here](documentation/STORYBOARD.pdf)

To keep track of the scene flow, I created a [flowchart](documentation/FLOWCHART.pdf) to track potential user paths. 

For a comprehensive overview of the game as a whole and the goals achieved, view the [Final Report](documentation/FINAL_REPORT.pdf)

## Development Environment Setup

### Unity Engine
This game was developed using Unity Game Engine 2021.3 version using a Student Professional license. Information on download details can be found [here](https://unity.com/) The android build support modules will also be required. 

### Visual Studio 2019
I utilized the Visual Studio IDE for development due to it's integration with the Unity Engine. Details on dowloading can be found [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

### Build Platform
The game was developed and tested on the Android platform. At the time of completion, the game supports Android API level 33 and below. In order to set the build platform in Unity, navigate to File->Build Settings and select the Android platform. ![image](https://github.com/crobin27/escape-of-the-arachnids/assets/76970281/7b670a2f-af09-4f5e-a1e7-a49f925ef9e3)

### Credits
In order to accomplish the task of developing a game by myself, I was able to outsource some aspects of the game such as Art and the NavMesh2D to save time. Big thanks to all of the artists below!
