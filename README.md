## About
Making use of the Unity Game Engine and under the supervision of Dr. Hugh Smith at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, I was able to further my knowledge of game development techniques through the creation of this mobile 2D Android game. Broadening my knowledge, I focused on including important aspects of the software and game development process such as version control, object-oriented programming, storyboarding, design flow, and user testing. The Unity Engineâ€™s cross platform build compatibility combined with its beginner friendly design made it the perfect choice to build the game on. 

## Documentation Files
Listed below are documents we have gathered that provide further insight into the development of this API.

To keep track of different classes, I've created a [UML diagram](documentation/UML_DIAGRAM.pdf)

In order to keep in touch with user flow, an example storyboard can be found [here](documentation/STORYBOARD.pdf)

To keep track of the scene flow, I created a [flowchart](documentation/FLOWCHART.pdf) to track potential user paths. 

For a comprehensive explanation of the game as a whole and the goals achieved, view the [Final Report](documentation/FINAL_REPORT.pdf)
